## Study association between disease and genotype ##

In this assignment, we are required to run a chi-squared test of independence. To do so, we used survey data of genotypes at an insertion/deletion polymorphism of the apolipoprotein B signal peptide in 2259 men (see Gardemann et al. (1998) for details).
