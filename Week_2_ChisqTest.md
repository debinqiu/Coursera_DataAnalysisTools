## Study association between Exercise and Smoke ##

In this assignment, we are required to run a chi-squared test of independence. To do so, we used survey data that contains the responses of 237 Statistics I students at the University of Adelaide to a number of questions. We selected a subset data consisting of "Exer" and "Smoke" columns because we want to study the dependence of Exercise and Smoke. To be specific, we were interested in columns:
- Exercise: how often the student exercises- "Freq" (frequently), "Some", "None".
- Smoke: how much the student smokes-"Heavy", "Regul" (regularly), "Occas" (occasionally), "Never".
Thus, the null hypothesis is that the frequency of student smoking is associated with the frequency of student exercise.
