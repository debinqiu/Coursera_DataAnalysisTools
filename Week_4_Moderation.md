## Alcohol consumption on the attractiveness of members of the opposite sex ##

In this assignment, we need to deal with testing a potential moderator (interaction). To do so, we run an ANOVA which includes the moderator. We used "beer goggles" data to determine whether the alcohol consumption has on the apparent attractiveness of members of the opposite sex. The data were collected in an experiment such that 24 men and 24 women were randomly assigned to a placebo (nonalcoholic
lager), 2-pint, or 4-pint drink. The independent raters give a photo of the person that participated in this experiment an attractiveness rating on a scale from 1 to 100. To be specific, the data contains the following columns:
- **attractiveness**: attractiveness rating from 1 to 100.
- **Beer**: drink level in pints(Categorical: 0,2,4).
- **Gender**: Sex (Categorical: Male, Female).
