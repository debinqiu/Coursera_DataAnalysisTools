## Study the association between the number of distressed O-rings vs temperature and pressure##

In this assignment, we are dealing with pearson correlation which measures the linear association between two variables. We used shuttle launch data containing four variables from NASA:
-**distress_ct**: number of distressed O-rings
-**temperature**: shuttle launch temperature
-**field_check_pressure**: field check pressure
-**flight_num**: flight No.

We will examine the relationship between the number of distressed O-rings and launch temperature, the number of distressed O-rings and field check pressure, respectively.
